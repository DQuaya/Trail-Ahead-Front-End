# Trail Ahead APP

This is a companion APP to the [Trail Ahead](https://github.com/kevncrypting/Trail-Ahead-Back-End) hiking application. It is built with [React](https://react.dev/) and uses [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/). This app was styled using CSS, along with a couple react animations.

## Features

The APP brings hikers from every experience level together.  Whether you are looking for a hiking companion or a hiking group, Trail Ahead has something for you. Users or Groups will be able to post an upcoming hike and allow others to join them.  Users will be able to see the experience level of every member.   

- Each **Hike** has a `hikeLeader`. (more details to come soon)

### Wire Frames:

Along with the user stories and problems, our group developed several wireframes, that showed how we thought the app should look and where each filter should be located on the application.  We built and style the application based on these wireframes.
Here is the link of the Wire Frames the group used as guidance to building and styling the application.
